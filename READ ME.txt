Hello

 In the flluter-app folder, there are PHP files and database backups. You can use localhost,in htdocs file (xamp) or www (wamp).
 Put the Flutter app in the htdocs folder and import the database backup into the database.
 Note: After opening Flutter, change the IP addresses!
 This program is an application that retrieves images and sliders from the database and displays them. Each product has a gallery and comment section that displays comments stored in the database, and sliders have a price and product name.
 Thank you for your attention.
